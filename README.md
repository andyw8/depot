## Overview ##

This project is an example of applying the page object pattern with Cucumber. It is intended as demonstration of the [capybara-page-object](http://github.com/andyw8/capybara-page-object) gem which I am developing.

It is based on the [Depot application](http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/source_code) from the book [Agile Web Development With Rails](http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails).

Although the Depot application isn't particularly complex, the principles demonstrated can be applied to a larger project.

## Toolset ##

There are many options to choose from when using Cucumber, but I think the ones I've chosen are fairly typical:

* RSpec
* factory_girl
