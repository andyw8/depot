## Overview ##

This project is an example of applying the page object pattern with Cucumber. It is intended as example of the [capybara-page-object](http://github.com/andyw8/capybara-page-object) gem which I am developing.

It is based on the Depot application from the book Agile Web Development With Rails.

Although the Depot application isn't particularly big, the principles demonstrated can be applied to a larger project.

## Tools ##

There are many options to choose from when using Cucumber, but I think the ones I've chosen are fairly typical:

* RSpec
* factory_girl
